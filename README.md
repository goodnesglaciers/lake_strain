Run NIF and create figures in Stevens et al. (2024): Limits to elastic stress coupling between supraglacial lakes.


/GPS_strain_rates: 
    
    code for calculating strain rates between GPS stations.
    
    Figures 5 and S2â€“5.


/NIF_L1A: 
    
    network inversion code for 20 km x 20 km basal plane and vertical plane along L1A hydro-fracture scarp. 
    
    Figure 2. 
    
    creates files needed to make Figures in /NIF_forward. 


/NIF_forward: 

    code for forward modeling ice-sheet surface stresses during 2011 and 2012 L1A drainages.
    
    Figures 3, 6, 7, S1, and S6. Movies S1 and S2.


/idealized_blister_forward: 

    code for idealized lake-drainage simulations.
    
    Figures 4, 8, S7, and S8.
